## Amy's Advent of ~~COBOL~~ Code 2020

My solutions to Advent of Code 2020.

My main language is [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), and this is what I write solutions in first.

The objectives for my Crystal solutions are:
* Be simple.
* Be clean.
* Be concise.

### Okay but why COBOL?

1. For the personal challenge.
2. Because it's funny.

I have no prior COBOL experience and am not a COBOL programmer. Let's see how long I can keep the challenge going for.

That being said, if you're an employer and you like what you see, take note.

### Other languages?

I write solutions in other languages when I feel like it and/or have the energy for it.
